# ResNet for CIFAR-10 with a restriction on parameter count
This is a repository created for public access to train &amp; test our ResNet architecture created for the CIFAR-10 Dataset. This model was created for a Project in the Graduate-level Deep Learning course ECE-GY 7123 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Created by Navneeth Krishna M., Anshika Jain, and Sharvari Gote.

## How to run?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/navneeeth/resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
cd resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
python resnet_model_train_and_test.py
```
You can also choose to upload the ipynb version of the code to a suitable environment and run the only cell.

## Python Libraries Requirements 
1.Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
2.PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.
3.NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
