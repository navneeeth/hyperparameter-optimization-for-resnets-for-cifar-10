# ResNet for CIFAR-10 with a restriction on parameter count
This is a repository created for public access to train &amp; test our ResNet architecture created for the CIFAR-10 Dataset. This model was created for a Project in the Graduate-level Deep Learning course ECE-GY 7123 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Created by Navneeth Krishna M., Anshika Jain, and Sharvari Gote.

## How to run?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/navneeeth/resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
cd resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
python resnet_model_train_and_test.py
```
You can also choose to upload the ipynb version of the code to a suitable environment and run the only cell.

 **About this project**
 
Designed a ResNet architecture for CIFAR-10 dataset image classification with the constraint on parameter count 
of 5 M. Resnet architecture is based on the concept of Residual Blocks. Tackled the CIFAR-10 dataset of 60k images using the PyTorch framework and performed calculations on images 
through NumPy. Visualized the performance for various models using Pythonâ€™s visualization library Matplotlib.Acquired an accuracy of 95% by using different data augmentation techniques and different optimizers while 
designing the ResNet architecture. 

## Python Libraries Requirements 
1. Matplotlib 

2. PyTorch - Torchvision 

3. NumPy
