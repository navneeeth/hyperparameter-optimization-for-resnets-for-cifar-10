# ResNet for CIFAR-10 with a restriction on parameter count
This is a repository created for public access to train &amp; test our ResNet architecture created for the CIFAR-10 Dataset. This model was created for a Project in the Graduate-level Deep Learning course ECE-GY 7123 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Created by Navneeth Krishna M., Anshika Jain, and Sharvari Gote.

## How to run?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/navneeeth/resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
cd resnet-for-cifar-10-dl-project-1
python resnet_model_train_and_test.py
```
You can also choose to upload the ipynb version of the code to a suitable environment and run the only cell.

 **About this project**
 
Image Processing is a growing domain among research topics in Deep Learning with
competitive innovations in Convolutional Neural Networks, Artificial Neural Networks,
& related domains. Atop the underlying principle of establishing patterns in pixel
representations of images, researchers have placed significant confidence in a technique
called ResNets (Residual Neural Networks). We present one of such ResNet models with
optimal accuracy on a standard CIFAR-10 dataset under a constraint on parameter count
while presenting milestones in augmenting the approach & describing behaviours in
model performance.Acquired an accuracy of 95% by using different data augmentation techniques and different optimizers while 
designing the ResNet architecture
